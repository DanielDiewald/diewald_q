            Essential oils are concentrated extracts harvested from plants,
            herbs, and trees, which are carefully steam distilled or cold
            pressed. These pure, precious oils are more potent than the
            botanicals from which theyâ€™re extracted and contain powerful,
            concentrated health and wellness benefits. <br /><br />
            Whether you use oils for aromatherapy, personal care, or as
            household solutions, all aspects of your life will get a boost with
            a few drops of essential oils!
